      <h2>Hello,</h2>
      <p>I'm Dimash and I'm learning to create websites to get away from my current position.
        I'm done with my previous work and don't want to work on it anymore.
        This site is not only a showcase of my "progress", but also my diary. I will write all my thoughts here
        in not the best english you ever read. So let my new the journey begin!</p>

        <h3>Engineering & simulations</h3>
        <p>I spent almost 4 years studing different simulations. Maybe, it was my biggest mistake.
          I was affraid to giveup what I had because I already spent time to master it, but now I look
          at my situation and have only one though in my head: I should've gone to computer science.
          But it is in the past and I can't change it. Sad, but true. All I have to do is to work hard now...</p>

        <h3>What I need to do?</h3>
        <p>I don't know. All I know I must do it and I can do it. The only doubt I have in me
        is my plan. Will it even wok? None of my serious plans were successful. From other hand,
      I never heard that someone got what they want just by planning. Maybe all I need to do is just work hard
    and, in one day, I will get an opportunity for which I will be ready. We'll see...</p>
